In this project, the goal is to demonstrate how to use the Gemma language model for data science-oriented tasks. Specifically, we aim to build tools that assist Kaggle developers in various tasks using [Gemma 7B-it](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch/variations/7b-it-quant). The project focuses on leveraging Gemma's capabilities to explain or teach basic data science concepts, answer common questions about Python programming, summarize Kaggle solution write-ups, explain concepts from Kaggle competition solution write-ups, and answer common questions about the Kaggle platform.

**Fun fact**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, supporting TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).

**Note**: Code is available at [Kaggle]().
